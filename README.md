# Music-Player-V2

Another version of my music player web application with a drag and drop feature and a song list feature. I have developed this app with HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

- Created progress bar that can be clicked on to go to a specific time of the song.
- Audio files can be uploaded and are added to a song list to help the user keep track of what songs are uploaded in the music player
- User can switch songs with next and previous button
- Play and Pause Button
- File upload with button and drag and drop feature
- Name, duration, and current time of the song being played are displayed
